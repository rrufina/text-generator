My Heart –
We are thus far separated – but after all one mile is as bad as a thousand – which is a great consolation to one who must 
travel six hundred before he meets you again.  If it will give you any satisfaction – I am as comfortless as a pilgrim with 
peas in his shoes – and as cold as Charity – Chastity or any other Virtue.
