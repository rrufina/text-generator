This should be a very easy letter to writeâ€”words should come easily and in short it should be simple for me to tell you how desperately happy I was to open the paper and see the announcement of our engagement, but somehow I can't possibly say all in a letter I should like to. 
I love you, precious, with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life. 
How often I have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day. 
How lucky our children will be to have a mother like you...
