I am sure that by now, you understand the level of respect I have for you. It is not because you did anything special to earn it, but because of the value, I place on you. Someone as priceless as you merit the highest form of regard from a man. To me, you are an alpha female, a star that will shine on through the darkest of nights. I want to be able to look at you and feel my shoulders swell up. I want to take you places, feeling like the luckiest man in the whole world. Hence, my respect for you, my love.
