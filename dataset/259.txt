Thinking about you brings me inexplicable joy. Regardless of how bad my day has been, I know I can always count on you to make me feel better. No one else makes me smile easily like you. What would I do without the strength you give me and the happiness you infuse? Where would I be without the lighthouse guide of your diligent soul? I am exceptionally blessed to hold your hands and stamp my identity on your lips. I thank God for the peace and completeness you bring into my life.
