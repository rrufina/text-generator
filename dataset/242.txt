Dear, My life is beautiful because of you my love my lady love. You entered into my life as a candlelight in the dark. You showed me the meaning of love not with your words but with your care. I know your shy nature doesnâ€™t let you open up to me; but your eyes speak up the love you have for me. Love you a lot.
