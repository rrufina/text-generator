What I feel about you is greater than the wonders of the world, deep than the ocean, and higher than all the mountains combined. You inspire brilliance, diligence, and excellence in the noblest ways, and I am proud to call you mine. While I might not always have the most mind-blowing words, I will always have enough love to keep you happy on your worst days and even make your good days better. I am not afraid to let you know that my world revolves around you all year long and that you will always have a special place in my heart. I pray that we never lose our wonder and affection for each other.
