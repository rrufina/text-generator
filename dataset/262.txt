Oh yes! You are full of pleasant wonders, and I know this with all that is within me. Every day, you create great moments for my life, each new one outshining the former. If I were not your man, I would have thought you were a magician. Nothing seems to dampen your spirit, and you take great pride in that. Anything you lay your hands on starts working, even if it had been frustrating for others. Honestly, I canâ€™t help but love you deeper each day.
