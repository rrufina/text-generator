Meeting you was the beginning of a 360 degrees turnaround for my life. I have become humble and accomplished ever since you came around. In essence, your presence changed my life. The best part about it is that I didn’t expect to fall for you this hard. All I know is that I never want to go back to the person I was because there’s no sweeter life than the one you’ve given me. The day I met you was divine, and I hope that someday, we will officially make it a day worth celebrating in our lives. Thank you for everything you’ve done for me. I believe our love will echo throughout humanity’s existence.
