I have something stupid and ridiculous to tell you.  I am foolishly writing to you instead of having told you this, I do not 
know why, when returning from that walk.
To-night I shall be annoyed at having done so.  You will laugh in my face, will take me for a maker of phrases in all my relations 
with you hitherto.  You will show me the door and you will think I am lying.
I am in love with you.  I have been thus since the first day I called on you.
Alfred de Musset
