When we are together, seconds quickly turn into minutes and minutes to hours. From hours into a day, then to weeks, all in close succession. You make time fly when you are around. I want you to know what a wonder you have been to my world, but you know that words are not my strong suit. You have been the best for me in all times and all things. You are like an angel who has been more than a friend to me.
