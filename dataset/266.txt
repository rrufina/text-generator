Because of you, my life has become magical and worth living. As candlelight lights up a dark room, so do you light up my world. You have constantly shown me how much you care through words and deeds, and I pray we will grow stronger in love and affection. No one compares to you, my baby. Let your eyes continue blazing with zeal and your smile with warmth.
