i can't say how every time i ever put my arms around you i felt that i was home
since i left you, i have been constantly depressed
my happiness is to be near you
incessantly i live over in my memory your caresses, your tears, your affectionate solicitude
nothing compares to your hands, nothing like the green-gold of your eyes
all my joy is to feel life spring from your flower-fountain that mine keeps to fill all the paths of my nerves which are yours
though still in bed, my thoughts go out to you, my immortal beloved, be calm-love me-today-yesterday-what tearful longings for you-you-you-my life-my all-farewell
oh continue to love me-never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved
i love you, precious, with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life
how often i have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day
how lucky our children will be to have a mother like you
the important thing is i don't want to be without you for the next 20 years, or 40, or however many there are
i've gotten very used to being happy and i love you very much indeed
everyone is furious with me for going back to you, but they don't understand us
i feel that it is only with you that i can do anything at all,” wilde wrote
"do remake my ruined life for me, and then our friendship and love will have a different meaning to the world
i wish that when we met at rouen we had not parted at all
there are such wide abysses now of space and land between us
but we love each other
i wanted to let you know how much i adore you and appreciate having you as my girlfriend with this small letter
your image is always in my mind, i can always hear my heart whispering your name, and i can always see your face when i close my eyes
how i wish i can open my heart for you to see; i swear you will never find any trace of a black spot in it
i am yours now and till the end of time
when i was weak, you were my strength, and for that, i will be forever grateful
if my affection for you were an ocean, there would be no more land
if my love were a desert, you would see only sand, and if my love could grow wings, i would be soaring in flight
i am madly, deeply, truly in love with you
and i am not one of those people who deny themselves the simple pleasure of telling the truth
i am in love with you, and i do not care if we are all doomed or if there will be a day when everything we say or do has turned into dust
storm clouds may gather, and stars may collide, but i will be with you until the end of time
i got used to being loved, and loving you, and being happy indeed
that is why i just do not want even to think that i will be without you for the next ten years, or 20, or, however, many years there can be
you are more beautiful than a summer sunset on the ocean horizon
you are more breathtaking than the lush landscape on a mountain
you shine brighter than the stars in the country sky
you are more alluring than any song that was ever sung
i had not seen what the real meaning of beauty was until i found you
one paragraph is not enough for me to tell you just how much you mean to me
it would take me thousands of pages to tell you just how much i care about you
there is nothing in this world i could compare your tender hands to
and your eyes, i could just drown in them every time i look at you
they are the mirror of our love
it seems as if my body is filling with you more and more each day and night
seeing you every day is a blessing because my heart bubbles with excitement when anything reminds me of you
falling in love with you is the most beautiful thing i have ever done because every day has been colourful ever since
before you were a part of my life, everything seemed hopeless
i used to drift aimlessly and lurk in the dark
but since you came around, everything changed
you have given me more than i ever needed and reassured me of my value
thinking about you brings me inexplicable joy
regardless of how bad my day has been, i know i can always count on you to make me feel better
only the sound of your cute voice when talking to me sends chills down my spine and makes me seem like i am dreaming
from now and till my last breath, i will always hold you in high esteem because you deserve endless affection
you are a great woman among millions of women
you know you are my angel and my heartbeat
you make up for everything life deprives of me because you are a priceless treasure
i loved you from the start, and i like how your smile gives me confidence
i am forever yours, my darling
i wish you all the best in life because you love me; i am so glad to have you as my sweetheart
every day and night, your love is always in my heart
sweetheart, for me, your love goes further than the sky above us; it is deeper than the deepest part of the ocean
it is brighter than the brightest stars at night
and my loving wife, just so you know, whenever i think of you, your image raises my soul
you have given me so much love and encouragement that i do not think i will be able to return all that to you
you have been lighting up the darkness and bringing joy to my heart
when i am with you, i feel alive and strong
if it were not for you, my princess, my one and only treasure, life would not be so beautiful
as the candle fills the darkness with tender light, you enlighten my life with hope and love
the first day we met was the best day of my life
i found the source of life, joy, and happiness
you are my inspiration, and i treasure you beyond words can explain, baby
i am beyond grateful for being my answered prayer many years ago
even when times were hopeless for me, you showed up with firmness and loyalty
a day that is void of your voice is to mean an incomplete one
with your voice comes the soul melting laughter which is all i need to have a great and happy day
i hope mine makes you feel the same way
hi baby, i want you to know that no one can replace you
the way you look, the way you always know what i am thinking about, the way you hugged me when i needed it the most, and the way you listen to me is priceless
you have touched me more profoundly than i ever thought you could
i will cherish you till the end of time because you have been the reason for my constant strive to reach great heights
on a platter of gold and diamonds, your love brought happiness and peace of mind to me
one of the best things about love is knowing that whatever roads life takes, whatever ups and downs wait for us, whatever untrodden paths we have to go through, we will always be with each other
your voice is angelic and unique, sweeter than the early morning birds
your touch is electric and therapeutic to calm my nerves on difficult days
i am so glad to have met you in this life because you gave me a reason to want to always live with you until the end of time
you are my dream come true, the pearl of passion sent to me
do i adore you? my god, if your love were a grain of sand, mine would be a universe of beaches!
you are my dream come true, the love of my life
i wish you happiness and fulfilment because your presence in my life means so much
now i am so calm, not worrying anymore because you are by my side
i thank god because i spend every day in bliss, and i handle the day's task with happiness because i have you
i thank him for bringing you into my life
sometimes i get caught up with life's issues, and i start to worry
i get down and alone in thoughts, i feel like a lost child without a home, but the kind of affection you give me keeps me hanging on
all i will ever need is you
thank you for always being there for me
the happiness you have given me is so special; my whole day is filled with thoughts of you
getting to know you is the best thing that ever happened in my life
you have become my breath with which i live and the reason why i smile every time
when i am down, you lift my spirits; you share the joy with me when you are happy
in bad and good times, you are always with me
you have taught me how to love
you gave me all the happiness in the world and made me the better person i have become
i cannot give you anything valuable enough to repay all your sweetness in my life
with you in my life, i have got enough reason to breathe every day
you are the best, and nobody comes close
i cannot afford to spend the rest of my life without you
thank you for making every moment with you golden
when you are around me, my world turns around, and i feel your passion swell up inside my heart
i love you because when i lose control of myself, you pull me closer
i wish i can always be with you for the rest of my life
in the beginning, i thought everything is over until now that you came into my life; i realize that hope is something worth having
i wish i can always be with you for the rest of my life because your presence has really brought good fortunes to me; you changed my life because you are kind
i just wanted you to know that i am so thankful for all that you are! you are smart, thoughtful, sweet, amazing, beautiful, and funny… this list could go on and on! i treasure you!
i want to be with you now, tomorrow, and every other day after
you show me love in different shades
you are meant to be with me because i cannot imagine how my life would be with someone else
i adore you, and i cannot find the perfect words to say it
we will be together as long as life keeps us
sweetheart, your love is deeper than the deepest ocean, extensive than the skies and brighter than the brightest star that shines all night
even when we know that nothing in this world is eternal, i know deep down that you and i will live together till eternity
i will love you forever, and i will never fall out of love with you
looking back to the beginning, loving you is one thing i have done right all my life
no matter what happens, my adoration for you is constant
thank you for being the brightest star in my life
i think about the time before you were a part of my life
i remember being aimlessly drifting from one place to another, for i was bereft of a cause in my life
then, along came you, and from that day forth, everything changed
what i feel about you is greater than the wonders of the world, deep than the ocean, and higher than all the mountains combined
life offers many choices to make, but loving you is the only thing i wish to do
when i first saw you, i was attracted by your beautiful face and your charming smile
but it was the beauty of your heart that i fell for
i found an angel in you that is more amazing than what's visible from outside
your kind heart won me over the very first day i met you
since the day i was born, i have never met a person as interesting as you
i want to let you know that love is something eternal; the aspect may change but not the essence
you never ask me questions and always give me endless support
through this letter, i want to express all the feelings in my heart for you
i am in love with every single thing about you, from the way you dress to the way you live your life
you are the only person in my life who deserves to be loved tenderly, and i am proud to be the one to cherish you
with you, everything i need in a woman is complete because you are so sweet and wonderful
i am happy today because you showed me the best of everything
i will forever treasure you
i can feel you close to me even though you are far away
so please believe me when i say i treasure you
thanks to the stars above, we came together
at first, it was just a liking, but soon, it turned into deep love
i will not lie; i felt something in my heart when i first saw you
that something was certain, something that told me that the feeling i got was true
and now i know that i have been waiting all my life for that moment when i fell in love with you
what i really want is not to be your favourite or the best you had, but to be your only one
i want to be the one who will make you forget the rest
i get lost in my thoughts, daydreaming about how wonderful you have been to me
thanks for being special in every moment we spent, and thanks for being my boo
i can write an entire book describing my affection for you
you have such a profound influence on my life that i cannot erase the memories of you even if i live for a million years
when i met you, little did i know that you will be the queen who will show me the true love which i have been searching for; i love you, my sweet angel!
you are my joy and happiness, the one whom god has bestowed upon me as a guardian angel to lead me to my destiny in life; i will like to let you know that i love you with all my heart!
because of you, my life has become magical and worth living
as candlelight lights up a dark room, so do you light up my world
you are the only one in my mind and in my heart
do you know the effect you have on me? even in times of stress, i find myself calmer than usual when i am with you
i always seem to find the lighter side in things and situations
this is so unlike me, the pessimist i used to be
you are the only angel in my heart
without you, i do not exist
i need you and you alone to survive the storms of life
you are such a perfect woman for me
i could barely meet someone better than you
you are the meaning of a great experience, and i cannot love you less
this love is so sweet to be true, it is so amazing to mess with, and i cannot thank you enough for your untold love
my heart is buried in the ocean of love for you
thank you for loving me
i may not say it out loud, and i may not have the guts to write it on paper, and yet here i am sending you this text just to let you know
seeing you smile means a great deal to me
i would never want to see you sad
i would do anything humanly possible to keep your face gleaming with smiles and laughter because your affection is everything to me
it is even more than what i bargained for, and i am glad i have got you
i am asking you to promise me one thing in this letter – that you will be with me always
our love is truly special, and there is none other like it
i feel as if i have won the lottery with you, a person so special and magical, who makes my life and my world a thousand times better just by being there
i hope you never doubt my love and intentions for you
as the stars light up the night sky, so does your love for me light up my world
regardless of the time and day, you will always have my unwavering love and loyalty
i love loving you, and nothing can change that
i believe in you, and i believe in us
so, never, ever lose hope because we have a beautiful future ahead
seeing you smile is enough food for my tummy
it is beautiful to be with you on a happy or sad day
your name is carved on my heart, and every time i am alone, you are everything i think about
i love you beyond your imagination
as your angelic name implies, you must be straight out of heaven and the most valued woman in my world
for that reason, i pat myself on the back whenever possible for choosing you to be my girl
every time we are apart, i want you to know that i am constantly thinking of you
i wish i had a chance to text you with real beautiful flowers or send you my heart in a message, with kisses as attachments
you are beautiful in the way you walk, the way you laugh, and the way you talk
inside, outside, and all around, you radiate with an ethereal beauty that no mythical creature has ever had
your laughter became the melody my heart craves to hear at odd times
and by odd times, i mean when there is nothing on earth that should warrant the sound of laughter in my life
at the beginning of my life's story, i met a lot of ladies who really disappointed me, and i truly shed tears in pain
that was until i met you, and you put a smile on my face
love is not something that you can express in words
love is something that is expressed by actions and felt with the heart
i may not know how much loved i make you feel but trust me, dear, you are the most precious thing in my life
you give me a lot of reasons to want to be with you for the rest of my life
this is because every moment shared with you gave me the happiest time of my life
i knew i was in love with you when my heart began giving in to many vibrations with just a single thought of you
with your love, my world has changed in every possible way
being with you still seem like a fairy tale
will there be a happy ever after? i bet there will be
ever since you came into my life, my world has been filled with happy moments
if i had to pick a favourite memory that i've shared with you, it would be impossible to think of just one
and that is because we had so many amazing times together, so it is hard to choose
i cannot believe that it has been years since we became a couple
time truly flies when you are having fun, and i must say that it was bliss getting to know you
i am looking forward to more anniversaries to celebrate with you
never in my life have i felt more alive and dedicated to anything
i promise to dedicate my life and my heart to you, and i promise to keep giving my time and energy to the wonderful relationship that we have built together
i just wanted to let you know how much i appreciate having you in my life
for helping me through the bad times and being there to help me celebrate the good times, i cherish all of the moments that we share together
i cannot thank you enough for being my shooting stars that made my dream come true
i cannot appreciate you enough for being the light i walk with through life's darkest path and for being my courage in all battles life challenges me with every day
i miss you, my dear angel, the treasure of my heart, the one i wish to spend the rest of my life with
holding you is the best feeling ever!
every day, you create great moments for my life, each new one outshining the former
if i were not your man, i would have thought you were a magician
i am writing to you, hoping to show you a glimpse of my mind and the  worth i have placed on you
you are everything i ever dreamed of and the only one who dared to love me, despite my shortcomings
what i feel for you is something special – thanks so much for making my life beautiful and filling it with such amazing details
i am truly blessed to have you as a part of my life, and i cannot wait for the day i marry you
when i say 'i care for you,' i mean every word of it
i am sure that by now, you understand the level of respect i have for you
it is not because you did anything special to earn it, but because of how much i value you
when we are together, seconds quickly turn into minutes and minutes to hours
from hours into a day, then to weeks, all in close succession
you make time fly when you are around
i want you to know what a wonder you have been to my world, but you know that words are not my strong suit
you have been the best for me in all times and all things
you are like an angel who has been more than a friend to me
the life i wish for is what you give to me
all my dreams you bring to reality
all through my whole life, i pray to be with you forever
i will give you all the happiness in the world if i can
i will feed you with all of my love every day
you were the missing part of the puzzle that completed me
before i met you, the world had been giving me so many reasons to hate
but, now i cannot keep hating the world because it has granted me such a sweet and beautiful person with a kind heart
every day is a celebration of having you in my life
i thank god for making it possible for us to cross the path right from the beginning because that was where my life gained so much impact on your love
you are my dream come true, the reason why a smile never leaves my cheeks, my pearl of passion
i just want you to know that i love you!
do i love you? my god, if your love were a grain of sand, mine would be a universe of beaches!
no one brings so much happiness to my life as you
in your company, i find love that i have never known before
i cannot imagine what my life would be without you
i want to spend the rest of my life with you
dear… i love you since the moment you came into my life
i look forward get a glimpse of yours every day
you have touched me deeply like on one else
the feelings are so very difficult to express
today i have gathered the courage to put forth my love before you
i just wanted you to know how i feel about you
you blew my mind away at the very first sight
so i took your heart away without any fright
baby let us seal our love this valentine!
i cannot believe that it is been a year since we became couple
time truly flies when you are having fun and i must say that it was a bliss having you
happy anniversary, baby and i am looking forward for more anniversaries to celebrate with you
you are my shining star; you make me feel loved and special
thanks for being the girl of my dreams
i don’t need the sun because you are the sun in my life, your shine brightens up my life, i am very sure of loving you forever
i know that i cannot give you the world, but i promise to hold on to you forever
there is nothing that would give me greater joy than to see you happy always
you are the best thing since god made man
forever you will be the queen of my heart
your love is everything to me
sweetheart, your love is deeper than the deepest ocean, extensive than the skies and brighter than the brightest star that shines all night
the love you have given me is so special, my whole day is filled with thoughts of you, falling in love with you is the best thing that ever happened in my life
you are part of my life that i have been searching for all these years
finally i found you
i have never felt this way in my entire life; i want to be with you always
after everything that i’ve been through, i never believed i would find someone like you
having met you in my life is like finding a needle in the field full of grass
no one has a perfect past, and everyone has a sad story to tell, you never got tired of listening to mine
you make me believe that i am worth loving despite my imperfections
i never saw you wanting to give up on me even if there were times i was under the weather
i just want to tell you that i am more than happy and thankful to have you in my life
i think about the time before you were a part of my life
i remember being aimlessly drifting from one place to another, for i was bereft a cause in my life
along came you and from that day forth everything changed
you have given me so much that i can never pay you back and i know that i can only spend my lifetime loving you and make you feel safe and secure in my arms
i know that you are that once in a lifetime gift that is bestowed upon lucky ones from heaven above and you mean the world to me
my love, there is nothing more beautiful in the world than the love that we share darling
for never have to people come together in such perfect harmony
we complete each other, in ways that we never even thought were possible
we met at a time when self-doubt plagued us both and probably in that hour of need we bonded
that bond grew stronger over time and i know now that we were meant to be all along
the fact that i have you in my life, to love and to hold makes me feel alive and you my dear make me feel blessed to have you
i send you much love and fondness to you with this letter
my adorable wife, how far can you go for me? i am keen to go far and beyond just to let you realize that you are the most excellent thing that has happened to me!
when i am down you lift my spirits, when you are happy you share the joy with me
in bad and good times you are always with me
you have taught me how to love
what i feel for you is something special – thanks so much for making my life beautiful and filling it with such amazing details
my loving wife, you raise my soul every time i think of you
you are my sunrise and the shining star!
it is not bad to miss someone every now and then, but it hurts too much that our separation becomes unbearable
this is exactly how i am feeling right now and it is this feeling that i would like to preserve forever in my heart
sweetheart, i wanted to write you a love letter
i know it is a little silly but i thought i’d try anyway
it is just that i feel so much when i am with you that i try to put it in words, so that you know how i feel about you
i cannot see you right now but i can picture how you are
i see your hair and the way it falls on your shoulders, the way you smile and how you look right before you laugh
i want to be next to you right now
i don’t want you to hold anything back
seeing you smile means a great deal for me, i would never want to see you sad
i would do anything humanly possible to keep your face all glomming with smiles and laughter, because your love is everything to me
it is even more than what i bargained for, i am glad i have got you, i love you so much
knowing you are with me makes my life a dream come true
remembering our first kiss is remembering since when my heart beats for you
when we first held hands, our souls became one
seeing you is feeling everything is fine
my love, i share all my feelings with you
i am so thankful to god for giving me the best girlfriend in the world whose love cannot be replaced by anyone
i love you honey
the love you have given me is so special, my whole day is filled with thoughts of you, falling in love with you is the best thing that ever happened in my life
i am in love with you, and i am not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things
thank you for loving me
i may not say it out loud, and i may not have the guts to write it on paper, and yet here i am sending you this just to let you know
there’s no other woman in this world who can love me the way you do
and most of the time, you don’t even have to try
there’s something about the way you care about me, the way you talk to me, the way you touch me that makes me feel like i am truly alive
so thank you for giving me your love, and thank you for taking my love in return
i remember the first time i saw you
i knew i wanted to be with you from the moment i laid eyes on you
i couldn’t stop looking at you, your eyes, your smile – you stole my heart the first moment you spoke
i didn’t believe in love at first sight until i met you
and to this day, i cannot believe you chose me to be with you
you are everything i want as a partner and you are mine
don’t think for a minute that i don’t appreciate everything you do for us
you are everything to me and i love you
not a day goes by when my mind does not think of you, you are the reason behind every joy that has ever been a part of my life
you are the one who made me see the beauty of things
before you came into my life, i was sad, alone and broken
then you came in and turned my world around and changed everything for the better
i cannot thank you enough, all i can do to repay you is to love you unconditionally and wholeheartedly
you are every dream of mine come true and i love you with all my heart and soul
i am truly blessed to have you as a part of my life and i cannot wait for the day when we start a new life
when i say ‘i love you’, i mean every word of it
i just wanted you to know that i am so thankful for all that you are! you are smart, thoughtful, sweet, amazing, beautiful, and funny… this list could go on and on! happy anniversary!
you are the finest, loveliest, tenderest, and most beautiful person i have ever known—and even that is an understatement
storm clouds may gather and stars may collide, but i love you until the end of time
your image is always in my mind, i can always hear my heart whispering your name and i can always see your face when i close my face, how beautiful you are
my life has been so great with you
i feel so special to have known someone like you, i love you so much pretty
you are only one in my mind and in my heart
do you know the effect you have on me? even in times of stress, i find myself calmer than usual
i always seem to find the lighter side in things and situations
this is so unlike me, the pessimist i used to be
you are the only angel in my heart of heaven
i have been dreaming about you all my life, and today i express my love for you
i fancy holding your hand and enjoying the journey of life together
you are my dearest one
i can feel you close to me even though you are far away
please believe me when i say i love you
i know i cannot give you the world, but i can give you my heart, my love, and my affection
i promise to stay true to you and hold on you to for as long as you let me
though i cannot give you the world, i’ll do everything i can to make you as happy as you can be by my side
i feel like i am the king of the world right now because i found my queen
hi love, i want you to know that there’s no one who can replace you
the way you look, the way you always know what i am thinking about, the way you gave me hug when i need it the most, and the way you listen to me is priceless
you have touched me more profoundly than i ever thought you could
i want to let you know that love is something eternal; the aspect may change but not the essence
love asks me no questions and gives me endless support
through love i want to express whole feelings of my heart for you, i love you so much
spending time with you is undoubtedly the greatest thing ever
it is the most enjoyable thing i have ever done in my life
when i am with you baby, i have the time of my life and time flies by
but when we are apart, every second is spent in agony waiting to see you again
i love you and i miss you so incredibly much, cannot wait to see you again!
all i will ever need is you
thank you for being there for me
dear, my life is beautiful because of you my love my lady love
you entered into my life as a candlelight in the dark
you showed me the meaning of love not with your words but with your care
i know your shy nature doesn’t let you open up to me; but your eyes speak up the love you have for me
you mean the world to me, i say this from the bottom of my heart
thank you for sharing part of your heart with me
i will love you forever and nothing can change that
you have given me so much love and encouragement that i don’t think i will be able to return all that to you
you have been lighting up the dark and bringing joy to my heart
when i am with you i feel alive and strong
i have no choice but to always be in love with you because you have been so kind to me
you mean the whole world and i love you!
your voice is angelic and unique, sweeter than the early morning birds
your touch is electric and therapeutic to calm my nerves on difficult days
gazing into the starry sky in your eyes is all i want to do for the rest of my life
there is no choice but to stand in awe and admiration of you
i never knew what love meant until i met you
you have been my rock, my guiding light, and the only person i want
meeting you was the beginning of a 360 degrees turnaround for my life
i have become humble and accomplished ever since you came around
in essence, your presence changed my life
the best part about it is that i didn’t expect to fall for you this hard
all i know is that i never want to go back to the person i was because there’s no sweeter life than the one you’ve given me
the day i met you was divine, and i hope that someday, we will officially make it a day worth celebrating in our lives
thank you for everything you’ve done for me
i believe our love will echo throughout humanity’s existence
i hope you never doubt my love and intentions for you
as the stars light up the night sky, so does your love for me light up my world
regardless of the time and day, you will always have my unquestioning love and loyalty
i love loving you, and nothing can change that
i believe in you, and i believe in us
so, never, ever lose hope because we have a beautiful future ahead
remember that we have each other’s back so, we cannot afford to get distracted by trivialities that may bring regrettable results
i cherish you, now and always
your laughter became the melody my heart craves to hear at odd times
and by odd times, i mean when there is nothing on earth that should warrant the sound of laughter in my life
but somehow, yours is an addiction that my heart cannot get over
i promise to do everything in my power to keep you out of harm’s way
i pray that your charisma and melodious laughter lasts for the rest of our lives
if not for anything, remember that it is for my sake that you have this irreplaceable gift
what i feel about you is greater than the wonders of the world, deep than the ocean, and higher than all the mountains combined
you inspire brilliance, diligence, and excellence in the noblest ways, and i am proud to call you mine
while i might not always have the most mind-blowing words, i will always have enough love to keep you happy on your worst days and even make your good days better
i am not afraid to let you know that my world revolves around you all year long and that you will always have a special place in my heart
i pray that we never lose our wonder and affection for each other
oh yes! you are full of pleasant wonders, and i know this with all that is within me
every day, you create great moments for my life, each new one outshining the former
if i were not your man, i would have thought you were a magician
nothing seems to dampen your spirit, and you take great pride in that
anything you lay your hands on starts working, even if it had been frustrating for others
honestly, i cannot help but love you deeper each day
i am sure that by now, you understand the level of respect i have for you
it is not because you did anything special to earn it, but because of the value, i place on you
someone as priceless as you merit the highest form of regard from a man
to me, you are an alpha female, a star that will shine on through the darkest of nights
i want to be able to look at you and feel my shoulders swell up
i want to take you places, feeling like the luckiest man in the whole world
i am in love with every single thing about you, from the way you dress to the way you live your life
you are the only person in my life who deserves to be loved tenderly, and i am proud to be the one to love you
i cannot get enough of your name on my tongue, neither can i seem to get my eyes off from you
the day you were born was a special one, and it rained heavily, a representation of the blessings you brought on the earth
you have a personality worth emulating, and i would be glad to spend the rest of my life with you
you are beautiful in the way you walk, the way you laugh, and the way you talk
both inside, outside, and all around, you radiate with an ethereal beauty that no mythical creature has ever had
the day god brought you into existence became the turning point for the forces that control the cosmos: they soon realized that they must do your bidding or be rendered irrelevant
and as for me, i wouldn’t mind globetrotting until i find the most befitting of titles for you, my queen
i am very crazy about you, and i love you so much
i am beyond grateful for being my answered prayer many years ago
even when times were hopeless for me, you showed up with firmness and loyalty
though we were just friends, i knew you were the one for me
thank you for believing in me when i had no proof of my ability to take care of another human being
it would have been near impossible for my life to be rosy and smooth if you hadn’t thrown yourself to my side in support of my vision
i honor you like my crown and as the jewel that announced my relevance to this world of men
my love will forever be yours
you might be an ordinary girl to many, but to me, you are more precious than diamonds
seeing you happy is all i care about, not so much because you care about me, but because you are amazing
you deserve the finer things in life
everything about you gives me goosebumps, and i know that my love for you is not superficial
thank you for being closer than a sister and more caring than a mother
as your angelic name implies, you must be straight out of heaven and the most valued woman in my world
for that reason, i pat myself at the back whenever possible for the right choice of making you, my wife
it has been the best decision i ever made, and i thank the almighty for bringing us this far
thank you for opening up my inner eyes to see the best things in life and for unlocking the portals of great potential
i care about you so much that i wouldn’t mind being called your fool
i am always yours as you are mine forever
before you were a part of my life, everything seemed hopeless
i used to drift aimlessly and lurk in the dark
but since you came around, everything changed
you have given me more than i ever needed and reassured me of my value
thanks to you, i have complete confidence in myself
you are a lifetime gift that was freely given to me by god as compensation for all the love i never got to experience when growing up
i always knew you were the one for me
no, it is not because you connect with me on a deeper level than others
the truth is, i have shared only had few connections with others in the past
but with you, i feel complete
i have peace and inexplicable joy
i swear by the breath in me that i will never give you up for any reason because that would be the end of me
even after death, i believe we will be connected eternally
i love you forever, and that is the only thing that matters
thinking about you brings me inexplicable joy
regardless of how bad my day has been, i know i can always count on you to make me feel better
no one else makes me smile easily like you
i thank god for the peace and completeness you bring into my life
because of you, my life has become magical and worth living
as candlelight lights up a dark room, so do you light up my world
you have constantly shown me how much you care through words and deeds, and i pray we will grow stronger in love and affection
no one compares to you, my baby
let your eyes continue blazing with zeal and your smile with warmth
i chose you among millions of men to pour out my love on you
you are simply irresistible and a replica of the rarest diamond
i don’t know how my eyes and feet led me to you, but i am convinced that god wants the best for me
you make life so much easier for me in ways i didn’t think were possible
never for once have i regretted knowing you
i am thankful for every day that i get to spend in your presence
i reaffirm my loyalty to you on this day and promise that i will never let you down
today is not your birthday, neither is it our anniversary, but i felt the need to write you this love letter
if i could count my blessings, you would be the first one on the list
you are the center of my life and the best support system any human would get
my existence revolves around you, so it would be impossible for anyone or anything else to take your place
on this ordinary day, i would like to reassure you of my lifetime commitment to you
i promise to love you with everything i have and cherish you till my final breath
thank you for being mine
