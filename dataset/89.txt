Since I left you, I have been constantly depressed. 
My happiness is to be near you. 
Incessantly I live over in my memory your caresses, your tears, your affectionate solicitude.
The charms of the incomparable Jos√©phine kindle continually a burning and a glowing flame in my heart. 
When, free from all solicitude, all harassing care, shall I be able to pass all my time with you, having only to love you, and to think only of the happiness of so saying, and of proving it to you?
