My love, did you know that when you travel my heart becomes really lonely?? It beats really tight, slowly and sadly, because it can´t stand being away from you… You are the happiness in my life, I suffer a lot when I am obligated to be far away from you; I suffer a lot when I realize you are not near, and will take long to be with me again. I know the circumstances make things be this way. I try to conform myself but I can´t, because every time you go away, it is more evident how dependent I am of your love. I want you back, quickly, very quickly… Don´t let me suffer any longer and come back to my arms and to my love.
