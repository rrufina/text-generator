Thank you for loving me. I may not say it out loud, and I may not have the guts to write it on paper, and yet here I am sending you this just to let you know. There’s no other woman in this world who can love me the way you do. And most of the time, you don’t even have to try. There’s something about the way you care about me, the way you talk to me, the way you touch me that makes me feel like I’m truly alive. So thank you for giving me your love, and thank you for taking my love in return.
