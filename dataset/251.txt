After everything that Iâ€™ve been through, I never believed I would find someone like you. Having met you in my life is like finding a needle in the field full of grass. No one has a perfect past, and everyone has a sad story to tell, you never got tired of listening to mine. You make me believe that I am worth loving despite my imperfections. I never saw you wanting to give up on me even if there were times I was under the weather. I just want to tell you that I am more than happy and thankful to have you in my life. I love you so much.
