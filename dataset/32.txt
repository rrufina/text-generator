But let me have this letter, containing nothing but your love; and tell me that you give me your lips, your hair, all that face 
that I have possessed, and tell me that we embrace – you and I!
O God, O God, when I think of it, my throat closes, my sight is troubled; my knees fail, ah, it is horrible to die, it is also 
horrible to love like this!  What longing, what longing I have for you!  I beg you to let me have the letter I ask.  I am dying. 
Farewell.
