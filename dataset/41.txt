Dearest,
I wish I had the gift of making rhymes, for methinks there is poetry in my head and heart since I have been in love with you. 
You are a Poem. Of what sort, then? Epic? Mercy on me, no! A sonnet? No; for that is too labored and artificial. You are a sort of sweet, 
simple, gay, pathetic ballad, which Nature is singing, sometimes with tears, sometimes with smiles, and sometimes with intermingled smiles 
and tears.
