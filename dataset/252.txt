I always knew you were the one for me. No, it is not because you connect with me on a deeper level than others. The truth is, I have shared only had few connections with others in the past. But with you, I feel complete. I have peace and inexplicable joy. I swear by the breath in me that I will never give you up for any reason because that would be the end of me. Even after death, I believe we will be connected eternally. I love you forever, and that is the only thing that matters.
