I’m in love with every single thing about you, from the way you dress to the way you live your life. You are the only person in my life who deserves to be loved tenderly, and I am proud to be the one to love you. I can’t get enough of your name on my tongue, neither can I seem to get my eyes off from you. The day you were born was a special one, and it rained heavily, a representation of the blessings you brought on the earth. You have a personality worth emulating, and I would be glad to spend the rest of my life with you. Thank you.
