I know how much you love reading, so I thought I’d try to write you a love letter. I’m no writer, you know this, but I wanted to tell you how much I love you on paper. I want you to have a memory of words and feelings. Though you’re not beside me right now, I am constantly having you in my mind. I see your eyes, your lips, I feel your hands and the feeling in my stomach when you smile. I wish I could be with you right now, I will be soon. I can’t imagine my life without you in it and though you’re far away right now, I can feel you right next to me. I love you.
