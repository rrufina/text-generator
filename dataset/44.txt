To Peter Abelard:
I have your picture in my room. I never pass by it without stopping to look at it; and yet when you were present with me, 
I scare ever cast my eyes upon it. If a picture which is but a mute representation of an object can give such pleasure, what 
cannot letters inspire? They have souls, they can speak, they have in them all that force which expresses the transport of the 
heart; they have all the fire of our passionsâ€¦.
