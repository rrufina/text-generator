My Love, There is nothing more beautiful in the world than the love that we share darling. For never have to people come together in such perfect harmony. We complete each other, in ways that we never even thought were possible. We met at a time when self-doubt plagued us both and probably in that hour of need we bonded. That bond grew stronger over time and I know now that we were meant to be all along. The fact that I have you in my life, to love and to hold makes me feel alive and you my dear make me feel blessed to have you. Happy Valentineâ€™s Day.
