I hope you never doubt my love and intentions for you. As the stars light up the night sky, so does your love for me light up my world. Regardless of the time and day, you will always have my unquestioning love and loyalty. I love loving you, and nothing can change that. I believe in you, and I believe in us. So, never, ever lose hope because we have a beautiful future ahead. Remember that we have each other’s back so, we can’t afford to get distracted by trivialities that may bring regrettable results. I cherish you, now and always. Don’t forget that.
