You are beautiful in the way you walk, the way you laugh, and the way you talk. Both inside, outside, and all around, you radiate with an ethereal beauty that no mythical creature has ever had. The day God brought you into existence became the turning point for the forces that control the cosmos: They soon realized that they must do your bidding or be rendered irrelevant. And as for me, I wouldnâ€™t mind globetrotting until I find the most befitting of titles for you, my queen. I am very crazy about you, and I love you so much.
