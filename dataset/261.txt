I am beyond grateful for being my answered prayer many years ago. Even when times were hopeless for me, you showed up with firmness and loyalty. Though we were just friends, I knew you were the one for me. Thank you for believing in me when I had no proof of my ability to take care of another human being. It would have been near impossible for my life to be rosy and smooth if you hadnâ€™t thrown yourself to my side in support of my vision. I honor you like my crown and as the jewel that announced my relevance to this world of men.
