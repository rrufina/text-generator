I am reduced to a thing that wants Virginia.
I composed a beautiful letter to you in the sleepless nightmare hours of the night, and it has all gone: I just miss you, in a quite simple desperate human way. 
You, with all your undumb letters, would never write so elementary a phrase as that; perhaps you wouldn’t even feel it. And yet I believe you’ll be sensible of a little gap. 
But you’d clothe it in so exquisite a phrase that it should lose a little of its reality. 
Whereas with me it is quite stark: I miss you even more than I could have believed; and I was prepared to miss you a good deal. 
So this letter is really just a squeal of pain. 
It is incredible how essential to me you have become. 
I suppose you are accustomed to people saying these things. 
Damn you, spoilt creature; I shan’t make you love me any more by giving myself away like this — But oh my dear, I can’t be clever and stand-offish with you: I love you too much for that.
Too truly. You have no idea how stand-offish I can be with people I don’t love. 
I have brought it to a fine art. 
But you have broken down my defenses. 
And I don’t really resent it.
