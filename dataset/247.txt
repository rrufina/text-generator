Dearâ€¦ I love you since the moment you came into my life. I look forward get a glimpse of yours every day. You have touched me deeply like on one else. The feelings are so very difficult to express. Today I have gathered the courage to put forth my love before you. I just wanted you to know how I feel about you.
