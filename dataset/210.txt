Spending time with you is undoubtedly the greatest thing ever. It’s the most enjoyable thing I have ever done in my life. When I’m with you baby, I have the time of my life and time flies by. But when we are apart, every second is spent in agony waiting to see you again. I love you and I miss you so incredibly much, can’t wait to see you again!
