I already love in you your beauty, but I am only beginning to love in you that which is eternal and ever precious â€“ your heart, 
your soul. Beauty one could get to know and fall in love with in one hour and cease to love it as speedily; but the soul one must 
learn to know. Believe me, nothing on earth is given without labour, even love, the most beautiful and natural of feelings.
