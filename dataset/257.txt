The much I can do for myself is to live in gratitude each day. I would never repay you for your goodness and kindness to me. Being grateful is the only way I can try compensating for all the love you have shared. Today, like every other day, I have every reason to thank God for bringing you into my life. You have helped me grow into the man I am today and shaped me to be a great dad in the days to come. Loving you has shown me how kind and fulfilling life can be, something I had never experienced before. The privilege to become your man opened up my heart and mind to understand how valuable I am, hence improving my self-esteem. I think about you every second of every minute, and I hope you know I would do anything in the world to put a smile on your face. Thank you, my love.
