You mean the world to me, I say this from the bottom of my heart. You have proven to me that love doesn’t cost a thing, because I can’t possibly imagine what I could have done to deserve this kind of love, thank you for sharing part of your heart with me, I promise to handle and guide it with my life. I will love you forever and nothing can change that.
