Today is not your birthday, neither is it our anniversary, but I felt the need to write you this love letter. If I could count my blessings, you would be the first one on the list. You are the center of my life and the best support system any human would get. My existence revolves around you, so it would be impossible for anyone or anything else to take your place. On this ordinary day, I would like to reassure you of my lifetime commitment to you. I promise to love you with everything I have and cherish you till my final breath. Thank you for being mine.
