My dear, your absence agonizes and hurts me, everything I see, hear or do reminds me of you. Distance is cruel, very cruel. As I´ve said everything reminds me of you. The flower shop in the corner: the chair at the restaurant, empty, the ice-cream shop, where we spent so many sweet moments, the pillow where I found a string of your hair…everything reminds me of you, everything reinforces the sensation of loss. The loss I feel when you are away! But there’s something that hurts me too much: looking at your picture and seeing you smile and so lovely. If you knew how much I miss that timid smile that was always upon your lips, you’d come back as soon as possible, and as soon as you got here you’d realize how much I love you.
