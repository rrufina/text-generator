My Mistress and Friend, 
I and my heart put ourselves in your hands, begging you to recommend us to your good grace and not to let absence lessen your 
affection…or myself the pang of absence is already to great, and when I think of the increase of what I must needs suffer it would 
be well nigh intolerable but for my firm hope of your unchangeable affection…
Henry VIII
