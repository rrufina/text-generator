I suddenly remembered that song that goes: “Letters are not enough anymore / I want to hear your voice…”. But I wish I could hear it right here, very close to my ears. I don´t just want to have you on the phone; your voice coming through the cold wires instead of giving me some relief, it only increases my pain. I want you close to me, whispering in my ear… Hurry back, my love! And be sure of one thing: when you return, you will feel like the most loved person on earth; this letter is just a sample, just a little drop of all the love you will be getting when you are back into my arms! Hurry back, my darling! Hurry back, my love!
