Before you were a part of my life, everything seemed hopeless. I used to drift aimlessly and lurk in the dark. But since you came around, everything changed. You have given me more than I ever needed and reassured me of my value. Thanks to you, I have complete confidence in myself. You are a lifetime gift that was freely given to me by God as compensation for all the love I never got to experience when growing up. I love you.
