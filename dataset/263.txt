Your laughter became the melody my heart craves to hear at odd times. And by odd times, I mean when there is nothing on earth that should warrant the sound of laughter in my life. But somehow, yours is an addiction that my heart can’t get over. I promise to do everything in my power to keep you out of harm’s way. I pray that your charisma and melodious laughter lasts for the rest of our lives. If not for anything, remember that it is for my sake that you have this irreplaceable gift.
