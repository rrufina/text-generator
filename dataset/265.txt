I chose you among millions of men to pour out my love on you. You are simply irresistible and a replica of the rarest diamond. I don’t know how my eyes and feet led me to you, but I am convinced that God wants the best for me. You make life so much easier for me in ways I didn’t think were possible. Never for once have I regretted knowing you. I am thankful for every day that I get to spend in your presence. I reaffirm my loyalty to you on this day and promise that I will never let you down. So, help me, God.
