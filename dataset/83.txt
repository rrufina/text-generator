My golden child, my pearl, my precious stone, my crown, my queen and empress.  You dear darling of my heart, my highest and most 
precious, my all and everything, my wife, the baptism of my children, my tragic play, my posthumous reputation.  Ach!  You are my 
second better self, my virtues, my merits, my hope, the forgiveness of my sins, my future sanctity, O little daughter of heaven, my 
child of God, my intercessor, my guardian angel, my cherubim and seraph, how I love you!
