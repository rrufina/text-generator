I cannot get that beautiful afternoon out of my head, above me where I lay the grass was silhouetted against the blue of the 
heavens, small clouds were rushing past as the wind drove them on an endless journey. Then close to me was the most lovely of 
all, your soft hair against my cheek, your kisses so cool and unearthly and my happiness was so great.
