I know I can’t give you the world, but I can give you my heart, my love, and my affection. I promise to stay true to you and hold on you to for as long as you let me. Though I can’t give you the world, I’ll do everything I can to make you as happy as you can be by my side. I feel like I’m the king of the world right now because I found my queen.
