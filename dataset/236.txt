My love, I have little to say to you right now, but this little means a lot: I miss you and I long for you. I miss you deeply. I wish I were by your side right now, I wish I could feel your breathing really close to me, I wish I could see the sun reflecting in your eyes, I wish I could feel your hand in my hand. I miss your voice, I miss walking with you hand in hand, our finger entangled/intertwined, I miss your skin and I miss your sweet presence. I hope this agony will not last forever and I hope we can meet very soon so I can tell you, face to face, how much I care about you. With a kiss, (name).
