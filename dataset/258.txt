I am writing to you, hoping to show you a glimpse of my mind and the priceless worth I have placed on you. You are everything I ever dreamed of and the only one who dared to love me, despite my shortcomings. You are my all in all, the sun of my universe, and the freshness to the air I breathe. Years ago, I had no one to write to in such great depth. But when the wave of love hit me, every pain and hurt of the past got washed away. Sweetheart, I desire to be the one who sets your heart on fire all the days of your life. It is only through this that I will be able to give you everything you deserve because you are a precious and irreplaceable soul. I love you.
