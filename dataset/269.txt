My love will forever be yours. You might be an ordinary girl to many, but to me, you are more precious than diamonds. Seeing you happy is all I care about, not so much because you care about me, but because you are amazing. You deserve the finer things in life. Everything about you gives me goosebumps, and I know that my love for you is not superficial. Thank you for being closer than a sister and more caring than a mother.
