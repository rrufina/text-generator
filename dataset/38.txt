I will cover you with love when next I see you, with caresses, with ecstasy.  I want to gorge yu with all the joys of the flesh, 
so that you faint and die.  I want you to be amazed by me, and to confess to yourself that you had never even dreamed of such transports… 
When you are old, I want you to recall those few hours, I want your dry bones to quiver with joy when you think of them.
