Your voice is angelic and unique, sweeter than the early morning birds. Your touch is electric and therapeutic to calm my nerves on difficult days. Gazing into the starry sky in your eyes is all I want to do for the rest of my life. There is no choice but to stand in awe and admiration of you. I never knew what love meant until I met you. You have been my rock, my guiding light, and the only person I want. Thank you.
